# preventflood
A java app built in 2012 that could help prevent flooding in flood prone areas.
My premise was that High concentration of carbon(IV)oxide in the atmosphere causes global 
warming which causes higher temperatures in the atmosphere that leads to irregular rainfall and 
rise in sea level.Rise in sea level can lead to flooding especially in developing countries. 
However,we can prevent/reduce flooding by predicting the level of sea rise
based on the value of carbon(IV)oxide for a period of time. The level of carbon(IV)oxide correlates according to
research findings, with the level of sea rise. This app prompts the user to drain off excess sea water 
(which can be treated and used for agriculture or other purposes) in order to prevent flooding that 
may result from this projected excess water flowing out of its banks.
